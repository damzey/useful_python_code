This repository is a collection of useful Python projects I have found online. This file consists of different projects that I can use for my personal sake.

Project 1: Animated Scatter Plots

In this project, I began by importing country-level data spanning multiple years, encompassing various national statistics. I then cleaned the date where necessary. Following this data preprocessing phase, I then conducted basic analysis to calculate and visualise correlation between the numerical varaibles.However, the pinnacle of this endeavor was the creation of an animated scatter plot. This dynamic visualization encapsulates the evolving relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy across diverse countries over time. Notably, the scatter plot employs marker size to depict population size and marker color to distinguish between different nations, thus offering a comprehensive depiction of the interplay between these key indicators.

Python libraries used: plotly.express, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Project 2: Creating Fake Data

In this project, I generated 50 fake profiles using the Faker library and converted this data into a pandas DataFrame.

Python libraires used: pandas, Faker

Project 3: CV Scanner

In this project, users are prompted to input a link to a resume file. The code then parses the content of the file, extracting various pieces of information such as name, email, and other relevant details. Each extracted piece of information is paired with its corresponding category label, offering a concise summary of the most pertinent details found within the resume.

Python libraries used: pyresparser

Project 4: Plot Annotations

In this project, I initiated the creation of two datasets named 'x' and 'y' to construct a scatter plot. Subsequently, I expanded the functionality of the code by incorporating annotations for each data point. These annotations were assigned corresponding month labels, enhancing the clarity and interpretability of the scatter plot.

Python libraries used: matplotlib
